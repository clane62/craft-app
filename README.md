## About

The site will allow craftspersons to create profiles for themselves and upload their work in progress and completed projects. Users will be able to like and comment on projects. It is intend to be a communtity space that will provide a place of inspiration and appreciation for all things craft.

## Bugs to fix:

This project is a work in progress with almost all features still being solved including:
- content to display via popularity (number of likes). 
- comment functionality
- user profiles. 

## Lessons learnt:
- it's important to consider the eventual structure and functionality I'm working towards at the beginning of the project.
- problemsolving issues with pulling data should be done in psql as the first step. 
- Dont add the log in feature at the beginning of the project. 

## Future features:
- content to display via popularity (number of likes). 
- add comment functionality to posts
- user profile page with history of projects. 
- admin privileges
- a whole lot of CSS.
